      Lindsay has been making fake microphones and forcing her mom to listen to mildly funny jokes
      since she was three years old. Since then, she has used real microphones to inform, teach, and
      entertain a wide range of audiences. In 2013 she hit the Jazz Dance Event Emcee Circuit
      (which is totally a real thing) at Atlanta Varsity Showdown and never looked back, working
      events such as Midwest Lindy Fest (MN), KLX (TN), MCX (TN), Rocktober (OH), and
      Whistlestop (IN). With over 14 years of Lindy Hop under her Keds, Lindsay loves the people,
      music, and culture of vintage jazz dance, and is thrilled to be the Master of Ceremonies at your
      event.

              Hedin, Kate has traveled to the greatest unknown regions of following
              and footwork. Aside from a love of classically inspired Lindy Hop,
              she is most known for her unique and elegant style of Balboa.<br><br>
              The result is an impressive resume. Kate holds championship titles
              in almost every major competition, including the American Classic
              Balboa Championships, the International Lindy Hop Championships, the
              Euro Balboa Cup, and more. She is also a highly sought-after competition
              judge. In 2012, she released two highly praised DVDs specifically for
              Balboa followers on technique and aesthetics. As a teacher, Kate is
              known and loved for her logic-based language, her unique methods of
              teaching technique, and, overall, never leaving student followers
              disappointed.<br><br>
              She is proud to have held, along with her friends at Get Hep Swing
              in Cleveland, the Guinness World Record for longest dance party ever
              (52 hours, 3 minutes). Her fashion is admired by many, her lines
              desired as far as the Orient. She also does trapeze.

              based in New York City.  They bring an exuberant energy and joy to
              every project.  Their combined resumes span the globe, together having
              performed on prestigious stages and dancing with Philharmonic
              Orchestras, touring with Broadway shows, working with Jazz at Lincoln
              Center plus appearances on, “So You Think You Can Dance.”  Michael and
              Evita have worked together for over 10 years and have been dancing Lindy
              Hop for 17 years.<br><br>
              Michael and Evita developed a home teaching regular classes at Dance
              Manhattan, New York City’s most recognized school for social dance
              (2005 – 2014).<br><br>
              Currently, the two teach pop up workshops all over the world and
              produce performance material for
              <a href="https://www.facebook.com/syncopatedcity">Syncopated City Dance Company</a>.<br><br>
              As dance teachers, Michael and Evita emphasize the understanding of
              anatomy and efficient use of the body. Connecting movements through
              elegant flow, clearly projecting direction within the body, and
              romantic personal interactions are what create their lead and follow
              technique. Above all other descriptions, one will surely say that
              Michael and Evita are inspiring to watch and possess a warm welcome
              to any student of Lindy Hop.  You can enjoy more of their instruction

              Naptown Stomp in 2013. He loves to see beginners nail their first

              Dave is also a big fan and promoter of St. Louis Shag and is considered
              to be one of the strongest shag dancers in the Midwest. You may have
              seen him in shag competitions and performances at events like The
              Nevermore Jazz Ball, Southern Swing Challenge, Lindy Focus, and more.
              Ask him to dance wherever you find him!<br><br>

              Kerry Kapaku comes from a long history of training, performing,
              and teaching ballet and contemporary dance, and has been dancing

              Hop while in college (studying dance!) at The Ohio State University,
              and has been hooked ever since. She is addicted to the joy of the
              dance, and brings that enthusiasm into every class she teaches,
              whether she’s teaching to a large group or a doing a one-on-one
              private lesson. Since 2012 Kerry has taught for The Ohio State University
              Swing Dance Club, SwingColumbus, and Naptown Stomp. Over the past few years,
              Kerry has competed in several lindy hop and St. Louis Shag competitions
              around the Midwest area and has placed at events such as Dayton Swing
              Smackdown, Lindy on the Rocks, SwingIN, Nevermore Jazz Ball, and
              Southern Swing Challenge. Kerry currently dances and teaches ballet
              professionally in the Indianapolis area. Kerry’s passion for teaching
              is evident in all of her classes, and she aims to cultivate a fun
              and encouraging atmosphere for her students.
