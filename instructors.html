              Bobby White is known worldwide for his individual dance style,
              expressive teaching methods, and floppy hair.<br>
              He is a passionate dancer of Balboa, Lindy Hop, and Solo Jazz and has
              won many national and international championship placements in those
              dances, which he teaches all over the world. His welcoming nature
              and humorous personality are complemented by his passion for the
              dance and in-depth instruction.<br>
              He is dedicated to exploring the art form and history of swing dance,
              as shown through his well-read blog, <a href="https://swungover.wordpress.com/">Swungover</a>,
              and the story-telling talks that he delivers at events. He is the
              emcee of Lindy Focus and other events.

              Following in the path of her great ancestor, Swedish explorer Sven
              Hedin, Kate has traveled to the greatest unknown regions of following
              and footwork. Aside from a love of classically inspired Lindy Hop,
              she is most known for her unique and elegant style of Balboa.<br>
              The result is an impressive resume. Kate holds championship titles
              in almost every major competition, including the American Classic
              Balboa Championships, the International Lindy Hop Championships, the
              Euro Balboa Cup, and more. She is also a highly sought-after competition
              judge. In 2012, she released two highly praised DVDs specifically for
              Balboa followers on technique and aesthetics. As a teacher, Kate is
              known and loved for her logic-based language, her unique methods of
              teaching technique, and, overall, never leaving student followers
              disappointed.<br>
              She is proud to have held, along with her friends at Get Hep Swing
              in Cleveland, the Guinness World Record for longest dance party ever
              (52 hours, 3 minutes). Her fashion is admired by many, her lines
              desired as far as the Orient. She also does trapeze.
